- 👋 Hi, I’m @DSBA-DM
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring more robust use cases for data science, starting with the delivery of more efficient and effective healthcare, education and employment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning DSBA PGC with UT Austin McCombs School of Business
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any Data science projects in delivering healthcare services and enabling gainful employments for everyone in areas of their passions (vs. just a paycheck)...
