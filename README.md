- 👋 Hi, I’m @DSBA-DM
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring more robust use cases for data science, starting with the delivery of more efficient and effective healthcare, education and employment.
- 🌱 I just obtained the certificate from PGC with UT Austin McCombs School of Business for Post Graducate Program for Data Science and Business Analytics
- 💞️ I would like to collaborate on any Data science projects in delivering healthcare services and enabling gainful employments for everyone in areas of their passions (vs. just a paycheck)...
